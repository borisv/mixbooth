So you wanna run a radio station?   

This repo serves as the basis of radio.smplrtrn.one or smplrtrn.radio or ddtdt.radio ...

However, it owes almost everything to icecast2, youtube-dl, liquidsoap and James Hunt's neat little dockerization of those and a smart vue UX.

If your not familiar with the concepts of any of these, head over to James' blog series (1-4) and grow as you play)))
